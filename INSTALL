At it's most basic, you can build and install FastCgiQt like this:

cd FastCgiQt
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j5
sudo make install

Currently, this will build and install FastCgiQt with core and database support, but
not with XSLT support.

DATABASE SUPPORT
----------------

By default, FastCgiQt builds with database support (the FastCgiQt::Database class).
This can be disabled by passing WITH_SQL_SUPPORT=OFF to cmake, like so:

cmake .. -DWITH_SQL_SUPPORT=OFF

XSLT SUPPORT
------------

If you are building against Qt 4.5 or later, you can enable the FastCgiQt::XsltService
class by passing WITH_XSLT_SUPPORT=ON to cmake, like so:

cmake .. -DWITH_XSLT_SUPPORT=ON
