CHANGES
(some of these will be API+ABI changes)
- Headers should remain as QByteArrays
- ClientIOInterface shouldn't present QTextStreams for in and out; it should
  present a raw QIODevice (eg a ClientIODevice)
- A reference to the request shouldn't be available; instead, Service::currentRequest()
  should be moved to ClientIOInterface
- ClientIOInterface/ClientIODevice do nearly the same thing. They should probably be
  merged.
- All input data shouldn't be copied to the Request backend; it should stream it, if
  needed.
- Standardise on Foo::Bar instead of FooBar (eg Request::Backend vs RequestBackend)
