FastCgiQt can be configured by an ini file in the same directory as the binary
(after symlinks are resolved) called '.' and the name of the binary; for
example, if your binary is called 'foo', the configuration file is '.foo'.

Currently, the only settings are caching related:

CACHING BACKEND
---------------

[cache]
backend={RamCache|MemcachedCache}

Memcached support isn't build by default - see INSTALL for details.
Both options have further configuration options, but have sensible defaults.

Memcached is superior, and shares the cache between multiple processors, or
even multiple machines.

RAMCACHE
--------

[RamCache]
maxSize=$bytes

This is the maximum size of each cache - keep in mind that there are two
caches: the file cache, and the request cache. This limit is per-cache, not
shared.

The default value of $bytes is 10*1024*1024 (10MB).

MEMCACHED
---------

[MemcachedServers]
size=$count
0/host=foo
0/port=11211
1/host=bar
1/port=11211
...

Where $count is the number of servers.
If a port key is set, FastCgiQt uses the compiled-in default in libmemcached -
normally 11211.

If size is zero, or this section is omitted, FastCgiQt will try to contact a
memcached server on localhost running on the default port. If this does not
work, the application will exit.
